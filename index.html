        <p>I am a visiting scholar at Stony Brook University (SBU), working in the Advanced Combustion and Energy Systems (ACES) Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from SBU in December 2024, with my dissertation titled: <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/3157041210?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses" title="View dissertation on ProQuest">Understanding the Role of the Internal Combustion Engine for a Hybrid Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Generation System</a>. The respective work pertains to the hybridization of internal combustion engines with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and in particular to the combustion of the latter's anode off-gas in an engine downstream of the SOFC. I additionally graduated from Delft University of Technology with a M.Sc. in Sustainable Energy Technology in June 2017. My M.Sc. thesis is titled: <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:af05e7fd-0c73-4750-ac85-79a136a72e9f" title="View research on TU Delft Repository">Determination of Fatigue Assessment of Monopile - Based Offshore Wind Turbines through Fidelity Quantification</a>, and involves the examination of different tools in identifying the fatigue damage of offshore wind turbines' monopiles. Prior to that, I graduated from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 2014 with a B.Eng. and a M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering. My thesis in NTUA's respective program is associated with reviewing net-zero energy buildings. For more information you can go through my <a href="CV_Ioannis_Nikiforakis_02.2025.pdf">resume</a>.</p>

                        <p>Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems are widely investigated in hybrid power-generation applications, with existing research centered around coupling SOFCs with fossil-fuel-based and renewable-energy technologies. High fuel conversion efficiencies in stand-alone SOFC operation along with SOFC off-gases containing hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), at temperatures reportedly over 850°C and elevated pressures, favor their integration. Four main types of technology were determined for SOFC hybridization in the conducted review. Wind turbines, solar systems, thermal power plant turbines and internal combustion engines (ICEs) dominated respective research. A unique taxonomy was developed to account for the supplied fuels, the system components incorporated within the hybrid configurations and their associated connections, resulting in 102 designs being established overall. 53 of the designs pertain to power generation. A SOFC/ICE application running on natural gas (NG) achieved the highest energy conversion efficiency (79.54%), with the anode off-gas produced by the SOFC stack being further utilized by a bottoming ICE for waste energy recovery. Additional evidence exists in prior literature to motivate the investigation into the viability of that bottoming ICE for NG-fed SOFC/ICE hybrid systems. Further research into the engine component for hybrid SOFC/ICE configurations indicated that homogeneous charge
compression ignition and spark ignition (SI) are the most prominent, with the latter mode
of combustion resulting into the engine’s stable operation. Performed experiments were
identified in which a dry gaseous fuel assimilating a SOFC anode off-gas (H2: 34.62%, CO:
15.85%, CO2: 49.53% by vol.) was directed to a cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine
operating under SI. Its combustion was examined at three compression ratios (9:1, 11:1 and
13:1), with the equivalence ratio, ϕ, ranging from 0.6 to stoichiometry. The experimental
investigations could only consider up to 15% water vapor dilution, due to physical vaporization limits and port fuel injection capabilities. Ultimately, this dissertation extends upon
the experiments to computationally investigate the combustion of real, wet, SOFC anode
off-gas and examine the trade-off between engine performance and energy cost of water vapor
removal, given that increased water vapor concentrations decrease combustion performance.
This is an especially critical relationship to understand, as technoeconomic analysis for sizing
and arrangement of components heavily relies on it. A 3-D computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) model of the CFR engine was developed to address the full spectrum of operation,
given that the respective dilution levels of water vapor and CO2 in the anode off-gas are
anticipated to range up to 49.6% and 25.4%. In that case, based on the stack’s design point
operating at 65% electrical efficiency, 68% fuel utilization, and 51.1% anode recirculation,
the SOFC anode off-gas concentrations of H2 and CO amount to 17.1% and 7.9%, respectively. Turbulence was modeled using Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes Renormalization
Group k-ε, while three chemical kinetics mechanisms were considered to model SOFC anode
off-gas combustion. The mechanisms were initially selected due to their increased citation
in relevant literature. They were implemented in modeled reactors to examine the resulting
ignition delay, τign, and laminar flame speed, SL, against ranges of temperature, pressure
and ϕ, relevant to ICE operation. Constant-volume modeling culminated in τign computaiv
tions and 1-D reactor models were developed to simulate premixed flames and acquire SL
values. Rate of production (ROP) and sensitivity analyses were implemented for the oxidation of H2/CO, to establish the suitability of the candidate mechanisms to SOFC anode-off
gas combustion under SI ICE operation. After the respective models were validated against
identified experiments, the chemical kinetics mechanisms were implemented in the 3-D CFD
model of the CFR engine to simulate the assimilated SOFC anode off-gas experiments. The
simulated engine model was further extended to combusting SOFC anode off-gas featuring
water vapor concentrations of 49.6% (by vol.) for two loading conditions. Operation was
then investigated at a system level, with water vapor removal being considered upstream of
the ICE for several loads to optimize hybrid operation in terms of fuel conversion</p>
