        <p>I am a visiting scholar at Stony Brook University (SBU), working in the Advanced Combustion and Energy Systems (ACES) Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from SBU in December 2024, with my dissertation titled: <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/3157041210?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses" title="View dissertation on ProQuest">Understanding the Role of the Internal Combustion Engine for a Hybrid Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Generation System</a>. The respective work pertains to the hybridization of internal combustion engines with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and in particular to the combustion of the latter's anode off-gas in an engine downstream of the SOFC. I additionally graduated from Delft University of Technology with a M.Sc. in Sustainable Energy Technology in June 2017. My M.Sc. thesis is titled: <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:af05e7fd-0c73-4750-ac85-79a136a72e9f" title="View research on TU Delft Repository">Determination of Fatigue Assessment of Monopile - Based Offshore Wind Turbines through Fidelity Quantification</a>, and involves the examination of different tools in identifying the fatigue damage of offshore wind turbines' monopiles. Prior to that, I graduated from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 2014 with a B.Eng. and a M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering. My thesis in NTUA's respective program is associated with reviewing net-zero energy buildings. For more information you can go through my <a href="CV_Ioannis_Nikiforakis_02.2025.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
