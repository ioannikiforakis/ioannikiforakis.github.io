        <p>I am a visiting scholar at Stony Brook University (SBU), working in the Advanced Combustion and Energy Systems (ACES) Laboratory. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from SBU in December 2024, with my dissertation titled: <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/3157041210?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses" title="View dissertation on ProQuest">Understanding the Role of the Internal Combustion Engine for a Hybrid Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Generation System</a>. The respective work pertains to the hybridization of internal combustion engines (ICE) with solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), and in particular to the combustion of the latter's anode off-gas in an engine downstream of the SOFC. I additionally graduated from Delft University of Technology with a M.Sc. in Sustainable Energy Technology in June 2017. My M.Sc. thesis is titled: <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:af05e7fd-0c73-4750-ac85-79a136a72e9f" title="View research on TU Delft Repository">Determination of Fatigue Assessment of Monopile - Based Offshore Wind Turbines through Fidelity Quantification</a>, and involves the examination of different tools in identifying the fatigue damage of offshore wind turbines' monopiles. Prior to that, I graduated from the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 2014 with a B.Eng. and a M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering. My thesis in NTUA's respective program is associated with reviewing net zero-energy buildings (NZEBs).

                        <p>Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems are widely investigated in hybrid power-generation applications, with existing research centered around coupling SOFCs with fossil-fuel-based and renewable-energy technologies. A unique taxonomy was developed to account for the supplied fuels, the system components incorporated within the hybrid configurations and their associated connections, resulting in 102 designs being established overall. 53 of the designs pertain to power generation. Extensive evidence exists in prior literature to motivate the investigation into the viability of a bottoming internal combustion engine (ICE) for natural gas (NG)-fed SOFC/ICE hybrid systems. Ultimately, the work extended upon in-house engine experiments to computationally investigate the combustion of real, wet, SOFC anode off-gas and examine the trade-off between engine performance and the energy cost of water-vapor removal. A 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the in-house cooperative fuel research (CFR) engine was developed to address the full spectrum of operation. Turbulence was modeled using Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes Renormalization Group k-ε, while three chemical kinetics mechanisms were considered to model SOFC anode off-gas combustion. The simulated engine model was extended to combusting SOFC anode off-gas featuring water-vapor concentrations of 49.6% (by vol.) for multiple loading conditions.</p>

                        <p>The application of stability checks in simulated offshore wind structures is performed through established tools in the respective industry. In particular, the structure should fulfill certain strength and fatigue criteria among which Fatigue Limit States (FLS) checks are critical. The fatigue assessment can be carried out in both time (TD) and frequency domain (FD), with the former being more popular in the offshore wind energy sector. Nevertheless, simplified tools in the FD have been suggested, since they yield results similar to those of the TD analysis. Fatigue assessment in the TD, the FD, and a simplified type in the FD were examined. These types are conducted in three respective tools: NREL’s FAST v8 and and two in-house MATLAB codes. The tools were judged upon the desirable levels of modeling & simulation fidelity. A set of criteria were defined to express that fidelity. After conducting further multi-criteria decision analyses, the eventual levels of fidelity for the three types of assessment resulted to a consequent ranking among the tools. The proposed fidelity framework was applied to a case study to evaluate the proposed methodology and to select the type of fatigue assessment and consequent tool that should be used within an early design stage. The results indicate that the simplified fatigue assessment in the FD should be preferred over conventional fatigue assessment in both TD and FD.</p>

                        <p> A review of Net Zero-Energy Buildings (NZEBs) was conducted for the program's thesis requirements. The database of this study was collected and further analyzed from 50 publications, with the relative amount of data categorized to a consequent structure. The European Union has set various goals in the field of energy, through standards and legislation, with which Member States should comply. In the building sector, which according to research accounts for approximately 40% of Europe's energy consumption, respective measures of energy efficiency should be applied with the addition of renewable energy systems. Buildings that generate amounts of energy from their renewable systems, that are equal with the amounts of energy that they are provided from the respective grid(s), throughout the nominal period of a year, are defined as 'Net Zero-Energy Buildings'. Model simulations and optimization procedures that NZEBs' design demands were implemented in several tools. The optimization of the buildings' energy efficiency and cost-optimality were followed by the introduction of methodologies through which the buildings' environmental impact was assessed. To conclude, two case studies of nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB) were analyzed.</p>
